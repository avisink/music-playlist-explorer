    - [x] If previously unliked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.

    - [x] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.
    - [ ] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please film yourself liking and unliking:
      - [ ] a playlist with a like count of 0
      - [ ] a playlist with a non-zero like count

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**
  - [x] Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist's detail modal.
  - [x] When the shuffle button is clicked, the playlist's songs should display in a different order.
  - [ ] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself shuffling the same playlist more than once. 
  
- [x] **Featured Page**
  - [x] Application includes a dedicated page that randomly selects and displays a playlist, showing the playlist’s:
    - [x] Playlist Image
    - [x] Playlist Name
    - [x] List of songs, including each song's:
      - [x] Title
      - [x] Artist
      - [x] Duration
  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [ ] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [ ] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

  - [ ] User can click the clear button. When clicked:
    - [ ] All text in the text input field is deleted
    - [ ] All playlists in the `data.json` file are displayed in a grid view
    - [ ] **Optional:** If the Add Playlist, Edit Existing Playlist, or Delete Playlist stretch features were implemented:
      - [ ] If users can add a playlist, added playlists should be included in search results.
      - [ ] If users can edit a playlist, search results should reflect the latest edits to each playlist.
      - [ ] If users can delete a playlist, deleted playlists should no longer be included in search results.
      - **Note:** You will not be graded on the implementation of this optional subfeature to keep your grade of this stretch feature independent of your implementation of other stretch features. However, we highly suggest including this in your implementation to model realistic behavior of real applications. 

- [ ] **Sorting Options**
  - [ ] Implement a drop-down or button options that allow users to sort the playlist by:
    - [ ] Name (A-Z alphabetically)
    - [ ] Number of likes (descending order)

  - [ ] Selecting a sort option should result in a reordering based on the selected sort while maintaining a grid view.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics covered in the labs were very helpful in preparing me for this assignment. The labs on DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with JSON data gave me a solid foundation for dynamically rendering playlists and handling user interactions like liking playlists and opening modals. However, I felt a bit unprepared when it came to implementing more advanced features like shuffling the playlist songs, making the modal itself, etc.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have implemented the stretch features such as adding, editing, and deleting playlists, as well as the search and sorting functionalities. I would also improve the accessibility of the application, such as adding better keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. Additionally, I would refine the UI/UX, making the modal transitions smoother and adding more visual feedback for user actions. I would also write more modular code and possibly add unit tests to ensure reliability.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During my project demo, I was happy that the core features worked smoothly, especially the modal pop-up and the like/unlike functionality. One thing that didn’t go as planned was the initial implementation of the shuffle feature, which took some debugging to get right. I also noticed that some peers had very polished UI designs and implemented additional features like search and sorting, which made their apps more user-friendly. Next time, I would like to focus more on polish and possibly use more reusable components to make the codebase easier to main
